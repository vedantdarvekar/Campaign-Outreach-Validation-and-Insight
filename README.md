# Campaign Outreach Analysis & Dashboard 📊

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **campaign outreach call data** to evaluate call effectiveness, agent performance, and application conversion trends.  
Using **SQL-based validation** and an **interactive dashboard**, the analysis uncovers key bottlenecks in outreach strategy and provides actionable recommendations to improve conversions and operational efficiency.

The project was completed as part of the **Excelerate Virtual Internship – Data Visualization Associate Program**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Problem Statement
Organizations invest heavily in outbound calling campaigns, yet:
- A large portion of calls remain **unconnected**
- Very few calls convert into **completed applications**
- Agent workload and campaign distribution are often uneven

This project answers:
- Where are calls failing?
- Which campaigns and agents perform best?
- What time windows maximize engagement?
- How can conversion rates be improved?

## Dataset Summary
- **Total Records:** 37,453  
- **Connected Calls:** 10,504  
- **Completed Applications:** 806  
- **Overall Call Completion Rate:** ~2%  

All metrics were validated directly using SQL to ensure data accuracy. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – Data validation, KPI calculations
- **Google Looker Studio** – Interactive dashboard creation
- **Excel / CSV** – Data cleaning and preparation
- **Data Visualization** – KPI cards, time-series, geo maps, donut & bar charts

## Key Dashboard Features
- 📌 **KPI Metrics**: Total calls, connected calls, completed applications, conversion rate  
- ⏱ **Call Trends Over Time**: Monthly outreach patterns  
- 🌍 **Geographic Distribution**: Record count by country  
- 🎯 **Campaign Performance**: Outcome breakdown per campaign  
- 👤 **Agent Performance**: Call volume & outcome distribution  
- 🕒 **Call Distribution by Hour**: Best time windows for engagement

## Key Insights
- **~72% of calls were not connected**, indicating poor contact reach or timing
- Only **2% of total calls resulted in completed applications**
- Campaigns with high volume still showed **low successful outcomes**
- **India contributed the highest call volume**, followed by smaller clusters in Africa and Europe
- Peak engagement occurred between **12:00 PM – 2:00 PM**
- Agent workload was **highly imbalanced**, with a few agents handling most calls

(Insights validated using SQL queries against the raw dataset.) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Recommendations
- Improve contact list quality to reduce unconnected calls
- Introduce structured **post-call follow-ups** (SMS/WhatsApp/email)
- Optimize calling schedules around **high-conversion time windows**
- Balance agent workload using performance data
- Standardize campaign-to-agent allocation
- Enforce mandatory data fields (e.g., country) during intake
